to create a request on browser we need to add method in our route

@app.route("/contact", methods=['GET', 'POST'])

now handle in function using request.method 
    not forget to import request from flask
        if(request.method == 'POST'):
             request.form.get('name')
    here name is an attribute of input in html form name="name(or email or phone)"
now use entry to entry in database like this

entry = Contacts(name=name, phone_number=phone, msg=message, email=email)
        db.session.add(entry)
        db.session.commit()

we need to add action="route_name" and method="POST" in our html form element(opening tag)
