we can send mail to our email whenever anyone will fill the form
to do that just install a package called flask-mail

    pip install flask-mail

Now import in your app file
    from flask_mail import Mail
now add this code 
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com',
    MAIL_PORT = '465',
    MAIL_USE_SSL = True,
    MAIL_USERNAME = params['gmail-user'],
    MAIL_PASSWORD = params['gmail-password']
)
mail = Mail(app)


you need to add params of user and password in your config file

when and what are you sending set like this using this function

mail.send_message('New message from ' + name,
                          sender= params['gmail-user'],
                          recipients = [params['gmail-user'], email],           # this will message on both
                                                  
                          body = message + "\n mobile number is:" + phone
                          )
