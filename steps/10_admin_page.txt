first of all create or copy paste admin login template and create login.html file 

add adminuser and password in config file to use it

add dashboard route in your main python file add get and post method 

take input from form and verify it from username and password from config file 
if it is true then set a session veriable and redirect to dashboard also check if user is logged in or not

before setting session veriable you need to define a secret key 
app.secret_key = 'super-secret-key'

this line check is user login or not
 if "user" in session and session['user']==params['admin_user']:
        posts = Posts.query.all()
        return render_template("dashboard.html", params=params, posts = posts)
    
if username == params['admin_user'] and password == params['admin_pass']:
            session['user'] = username
            posts = Posts.query.all()
            return render_template("dashbaord.html", params=params, posts = posts)

if user is not logged in then redirect_template to login.html

now simple show all post content in table format add edit and delete button in dashbaord table
