to see older post and newer post than

1. query all post 
2. define what will be last page (total post / no_of_post per page)
3. take args from url as page   
    page = request.args.get('page')
4. check that page is numeric if not then set page =1
    convert it into integer

5. slice post from all post according to need like this
        post = (page-1)*no_of_post : no_of_post*(page-1)+no_of_post

6. now define logic of next and prev

if page == 1:
    prev = #
    next = "/?page=" page +1
elif page == last:
    prev = "/?page=" page-1
    next="#"
else 
    prev = "/?page=" page-1
    next = "/?page=" page +1

now pass both variable in redirection and add in template
